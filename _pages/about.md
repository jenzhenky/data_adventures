I'm a data analyst living in New York City. Right now, I'm learning Python and data science by working on the projects on this blog and my [Github](https://github.com/jenzhenky).

My interest in data began when I was in finance and analyzed solar energy datasets as a leading indicator in investment research. When I worked in operations at a startup, I collected data to finetune the company's marketing campaign and improve client outreach. By learning Python, I hope to expand my analytical toolkit and help businesses make smarter strategic decisions.

### More about meâ€¦
- In 2017, I was the Head of Operations at [Spring Health](https://www.springhealth.com/), an early-stage healthcare startup for mental health. I established clinical and operational protocols, created the company's first marketing campaign, and managed client accounts.
- In the winter of 2016, I escaped from the New York cold and backpacked around Southeast Asia. I went to Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. 
- From 2014 to 2016, I was an equity research analyst at [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en.html) where I covered alternative energy. I created business and financial models, contributed to over 200 research reports, and performed due diligence for IPOs. While I worked on this team, my manager was ranked as the #1 alternative energy sell-side analyst on Wall Street by [Intuitional Investor](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b14z9xscy70zwl/2015-allamerica-research-team-alternative-energy-no-1-patrick-jobin).
- I studied Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology at Yale. While there, I did research at the medical school for three years and co-authored a paper on lysosomal regulation which was published in [Science Signaling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22692423).
